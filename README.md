# Gym23App
Repository for Gym23 shiny app and associated data.

This is a shiny app which takes input from a Google Sheet recording the weightlifting progress of users and generates plots to track and compare progress. Additionally, lifts (squat, bench and deadlift) can be compared to results from global unequipped powerlifting meets (https://www.openpowerlifting.org/). 

Google Sheet is private.
